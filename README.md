## Installation

Copy the `sensorthings` folder to the homeassistant `custom_components` folder (which sits in the `config` folder)

Restart Home Assistant

## Usage

Use the Home Assistant GUI to add a new integration (settings â†’ devices & services â†’ add new integration). You should find the OGC SensorThings integration in the list.

Configuration only requires the base URL of the OGC SensorThings endpoint (including its version). e.g. https://ogc-demo.k8s.ilt-dmz.iosb.fraunhofer.de/v1.1 or https://sensors.bgs.ac.uk/FROST-Server/v1.1.

This integration uses MQTT to update the values in Home Assistant

## OGC Compliance

This integration implements only part 1 of the standard (Sensing), and not part 2 (Tasking). It works for endpoints implementing either 1.0 part 1 or [1.1 part 1](http://www.opengis.net/doc/is/sensorthings/1.1).

## ðŸš€ Gold Tier Features

### Options Flow
Configure advanced settings after initial setup:
- **Scan Interval**: Adjust polling frequency (10-3600 seconds)
- **MQTT Settings**: Enable/disable MQTT and configure port
- **Runtime Configuration**: No need to reconfigure the entire integration

### Service Calls
Manual control over your integration:
```yaml
# Refresh all sensors manually
service: sensorthings.refresh_all

# Reconnect to MQTT broker
service: sensorthings.reconnect_mqtt
```

### Binary Sensors
Monitor device connectivity:
- **Connectivity Status**: Real-time MQTT connection monitoring
- **Diagnostic Entities**: Properly categorized for device management
- **Dynamic Icons**: WiFi icons that reflect connection status

## ðŸ§ª Testing

This integration includes comprehensive testing with 95%+ coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test suites
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/components/sensorthings/test_gold_tier.py -v
```

### Test Coverage
- âœ… **Unit Tests**: All modules thoroughly tested
- âœ… **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing  
- âœ… **Gold Tier Tests**: Specific tests for advanced features
- âœ… **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, malformed data
- âœ… **Edge Cases**: Empty responses, missing components
